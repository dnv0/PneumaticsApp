# PneumaticsApp
PneumaticsApp - educational application for visual designing of pneumatic circuits with simulation of compressed gas operations.

## Features
- Drag and drop interactions (adding components, creating connections, moving camera)
- Cabel physics
- 7 functioning components
- Information panel of component
- Right click menu for deleting elements or getting information

## Demontration materials
### Current interface 
Current interface has a very basic functional, that allows to add components, create connections and delete them, or open information panel.
